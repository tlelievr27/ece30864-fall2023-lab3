1) In non-Agile workflows, the role of a "Product Owner" is usually fulfilled by a Project Manager. The Product Owner in Agile development
    is responsible for directing the team and ensuring the development process is capturing all the intended value of the product. This
    requires the Product Owner to be regularly checking in with customers/stakeholders and making sure the work the team is doing is aligned
    with their needs.
