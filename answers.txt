1) In non-Agile workflows, the role of a "Product Owner" is usually fulfilled by a Project Manager. The Product Owner in Agile development
    is responsible for directing the team and ensuring the development process is capturing all the intended value of the product. This
    requires the Product Owner to be regularly checking in with customers/stakeholders and making sure the work the team is doing is aligned
    with their needs.
2) A Scrum Master is typically much more "hands on" than a Product Owner, as they are the ones managing the execution of the Agile methodology
    and leading development within the Agile framework. In comparison, the Product Owner is less involved in the actual development of the product
    and is more focused on gathering requirements from stakeholders and making sure the work the team is doing is relevant.
